imapnote2
=========

Sync your notes between Android, iOs devices and different accounts like Gmail, iCloud and others

This project is a fork of "imapnote" one created by boemianrapsodi (boemianrapsody@gmail.com). Probably Pasquale Boemio.
Some things don't work correctly but it was impossible to contact him to correct these bugs.

Original app is named "imapnote", and is available at https://code.google.com/p/imapnote/,
So I decided to name this one "imapnote2". It is under the GPL v3 License, as is "imapnote"

It is based on Apple way to manage notes. They are stored in an imap folder named "Notes".
imapnote uses Gmail for syncing. As I use my own imap server, I have modified it to be used with any imap server that respects Apple method. It has been tested with Gmail, iCloud (imap.mail.me.com), and of course my server. Even if not still tested, it should work with others like Yahoo for
example.

Main changes are:
- app can be used with other servers, not only gmail
- it's possible to open notes
- number of permissions asked by the app is reduced to minimum
- it works in landscape and portrait modes. Landscape is useful with some devices
- it's possible to delete notes (menu option on detail screen)

It is still possible to sync one way from server to device only

This app is available at Google Play under the name "ImapNote2". But for people who have not access to this market, it will be possible to compile source code. Furthermore, an apk will be available in bin directory.
